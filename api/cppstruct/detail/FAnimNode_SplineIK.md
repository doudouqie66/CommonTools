# FAnimNode_SplineIK

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| StartBone | FBoneReference | Name of root bone from which the spline extends |
| EndBone | FBoneReference | Name of bone at the end of the spline chain. Bones after this will not be altere |
| BoneAxis | ESplineBoneAxis | Axis of the controlled bone (ie the direction of the spline) to use as the direc |
| bAutoCalculateSpline | bool | The number of points in the spline if we are specifying it directly |
| PointCount | int32 | The number of points in the spline if we are not auto-calculating |
| ControlPoints | TArray < FTransform > | Transforms applied to spline points |
| Roll | float | Overall roll of the spline, applied on top of other rotations along the directio |
| TwistStart | float | The twist of the start bone. Twist is interpolated along the spline according to |
| TwistEnd | float | The twist of the end bone. Twist is interpolated along the spline according to T |
| TwistBlend | FAlphaBlend | How to interpolate twist along the length of the spline |
| Stretch | float | The maximum stretch allowed when fitting bones to the spline. 0.0 means bones do |
| Offset | float | The distance along the spline from the start from which bones are constrained |
| BoneSpline | FSplineCurves | Spline we maintain internally |
| OriginalSplineLength | float | Cached spline length from when the spline was originally applied to the skeleton |
| CachedBoneReferences | TArray < FSplineIKCachedBoneData > | Cached data for bones in the IK chain, from start to end |
| CachedBoneLengths | TArray < float > | Cached bone lengths. Same size as CachedBoneReferences |
| CachedOffsetRotations | TArray < FQuat > | Cached bone offset rotations. Same size as CachedBoneReferences |
