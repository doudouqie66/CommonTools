# FRootMotionExtractionStep

Struct defining a RootMotionExtractionStep.
  When extracting RootMotion we can encounter looping animations (wrap around), or different animations.
  We break those up into different steps, to help with RootMotion extraction, 
  as we can only extract a contiguous range per AnimSequence.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| AnimSequence | UAnimSequence * | AnimSequence ref |
| StartPosition | float | Start position to extract root motion from. |
| EndPosition | float | End position to extract root motion to. |
