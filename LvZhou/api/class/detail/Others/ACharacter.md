# ACharacter

Characters are Pawns that have a mesh, collision, and built-in movement logic.
  They are responsible for all physical interaction between the player or AI and the world, and also implement basic networking and input models.
  They are designed for a vertically-oriented player representation that can walk, jump, fly, and swim through the world using CharacterMovementComponent.

## Functions

### CacheInitialMeshOffset

Cache mesh offset from capsule. This is used as the target for network smoothing interpolation, when the mesh is offset with lagged smoothing.
	  This is automatically called during initialization; call this at runtime if you intend to change the default mesh offset from the capsule.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| MeshRelativeLocation | FVector  |  |
| MeshRelativeRotation | FRotator |  |

**Return:** void  

### OnRep_ReplicatedBasedMovement

Rep notify for ReplicatedBasedMovement

**Return:** void 

### SetReplicateMovement

Set whether this actor's movement replicates to network clients.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| bInReplicateMovement | bool |  |

**Return:** void  

### OnRep_ReplicatedMovementMode

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| LastReplicatedMovementMode | uint8 |  |

**Return:** void  

### GetReplicatedMovementMode

Returns ReplicatedMovementMode

**Return:** uint8 

### GetBaseTranslationOffset

Get the saved translation offset of mesh. This is how much extra offset is applied from the center of the capsule.

**Return:** FVector 

### GetBaseRotationOffsetRotator

Get the saved rotation offset of mesh. This is how much extra rotation is applied from the capsule rotation.

**Return:** FRotator 

### OnRep_IsCrouched

Handle Crouching replicated from server

**Return:** void 

### GetMovementBase

**Return:** UPrimitiveComponent * 

### GetReplicatedMovementBase

**Return:** UPrimitiveComponent * 

### Jump

Make the character jump on the next update.	 
	  If you want your character to jump according to the time that the jump key is held,
	  then you can set JumpKeyHoldTime to some non-zero value. Make sure in this case to
	  call StopJumping() when you want the jump's z-velocity to stop being applied (such 
	  as on a button up event), otherwise the character will carry on receiving the 
	  velocity until JumpKeyHoldTime is reached.

**Return:** void 

### StopJumping

Stop the character from jumping on the next update. 
	  Call this from an input event (such as a button 'up' event) to cease applying
	  jump Z-velocity. If this is not called, then jump z-velocity will be applied
	  until JumpMaxHoldTime is reached.

**Return:** void 

### CanJump

Check if the character can jump in the current state.
	 
	  The default implementation may be overridden or extended by implementing the custom CanJump event in Blueprints. 
	  

**Return:** bool 

### CanJumpInternal

Customizable event to check if the character can jump in the current state.
	  Default implementation returns true if the character is on the ground and not crouching,
	  has a valid CharacterMovementComponent and CanEverJump() returns true.
	  Default implementation also allows for 'hold to jump higher' functionality: 
	  As well as returning true when on the ground, it also returns true when GetMaxJumpTime is more
	  than zero and IsJumping returns true.
	  
	 

**Return:** bool 

### IsJumpProvidingForce

True if jump is actively providing a force, such as when the jump key is held and the time it has been held is less than JumpMaxHoldTime.

**Return:** bool 

### PlayAnimMontage

Set a pending launch velocity on the Character. This velocity will be processed on the next CharacterMovementComponent tick,
	   and will set it to the "falling" state. Triggers the OnLaunched event.

**Parameters:**

### OnJumped

Event fired when the character has just started jumping

**Return:** void 

### OnLanded

Called upon landing when falling, to perform actions based on the Hit result.
	 Note that movement mode is still "Falling" during this event. Current Velocity value is the velocity at the time of landing.
	 Consider OnMovementModeChanged() as well, as that can be used once the movement mode changes to the new mode (most likely Walking).
	

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Hit | FHitResult & | Result describing the landing that resulted in a valid landing spot. |
