# UAnimMontage

Any property you're adding to AnimMontage and parent class has to be considered for Child Asset
 
  Child Asset is considered to be only asset mapping feature using everything else in the class
  For example, you can just use all parent's setting  for the montage, but only remap assets
  This isn't magic bullet unfortunately and it is consistent effort of keeping the data synced with parent
  If you add new property, please make sure those property has to be copied for children.
  If it does, please add the copy in the function RefreshParentAssetData

> Inheritance: UAnimCompositeBase

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| BlendIn | FAlphaBlend | Blend in option. |
| BlendInTime_DEPRECATED | float |  |
| BlendOut | FAlphaBlend | Blend out option. This is only used when it blends out itself. If it's interrupt |
| BlendOutTime_DEPRECATED | float |  |
| BlendOutTriggerTime | float | Time from Sequence End to trigger blend out. 	  <0 means using BlendOutTime, so  |
| FilteredBones | FInputBlendPose |  |

| CurveForRootRotation | UCurveVector * |  |
| CurveForRootScale | UCurveVector * |  |
| BranchingPointStateNotifyIndices | TArray < int32 > | Keep track of which AnimNotify_State are marked as BranchingPoints, so we can up |
| IgnoreNotifyType | TArray < FString > | Names of notifies should be ignore in Montage. |
| TimeStretchCurve | FTimeStretchCurve |  |
| TimeStretchCurveName | FName | Name of optional TimeStretchCurveName to look for in Montage. |
