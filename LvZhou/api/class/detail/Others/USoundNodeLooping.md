# USoundNodeLooping

Defines how a sound loops; either indefinitely, or for a set number of times.
  Note: The Looping node should only be used for logical or procedural looping such as introducing a delay.
  These sounds will not be played seamlessly. If you want a sound to loop seamlessly and indefinitely,
  use the Looping flag on the Wave Player node for that sound.
