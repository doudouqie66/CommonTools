# FEdGraphTerminalType

Struct used to define information for terminal types, e.g. types that can be contained
   by a container. Currently can represent strongweak references to a type (only UObjects), 
   a structure, or a primitive. Support for "Container of Containers" is done by wrapping 
   a structure, rather than implicitly defining names for containers.
