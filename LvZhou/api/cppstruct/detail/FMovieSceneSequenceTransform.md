# FMovieSceneSequenceTransform

Movie scene sequence transform class that transforms from one time-space to another.
 
  @note The transform can be thought of as the top row of a 2x2 matrix, where the bottom row is the identity:
  			| TimeScale	Offset	|
 			| 0			1		|
 
  As such, traditional matrix mathematics can be applied to transform between different sequence's time-spaces.
  Transforms apply offset first, then time scale.

## Variables

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| TimeScale | float | The sequence's time scale (or play rate) |
| Offset | float | Scalar time offset applied before the scale |
