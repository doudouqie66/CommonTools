# FAnimLinkableElement

Used to describe an element that can be linked to a segment in a montage or sequence.
 	Usage: 
 		Inherit from FAnimLinkableElement and make sure to call LinkMontage or LinkSequence
 		both on creation and on loading the element. From there SetTime and GetTime should be
 		used to control where this element is in the montage or sequence.
 	
 		For more advanced usage, see this implementation used in FAnimNotifyEvent where
 		we have a secondary link to handle a duration
 		@see FAnimNotifyEvent
